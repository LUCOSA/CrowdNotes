# CrowdNotes

# Problem
Faster access to necessary resources like notes, revision materials, or just course books in general is key for successful achievement of a student’s academic goals, e.g. completing an assignment, doing personal research, or studying for an examination. This usually become a challenge because sometimes what you’re looking for isn’t there or it’s just hard to find.

# Solution
Our solution to this problem is using crowdsourcing to gather book in an organized catalog, and getting a resource you want is just one search away, and if it’s not yet available in the catalog, you just request and a notification gets posted out to anyone using the application who can get the resource.

# Target Audience
Students.
